# Destructuring and Nesting with Objects and Array

Today we will practice a bit of self research. This is a very important skill for every developer. It is important that we know how to search for information and be selective about it. A few tips for searching info are:

- Go to known pages or resources. For example: MDN, w3schools, w3resources, geekforgeeks...
- Normally they have intro and initial example. Read those and if you understand them, continue reading. If not search for another resource
- If you go to a forum or article, read the intro, normally this will tell how good or bad will be the explanation.
- Pages like forums are only good for specific answers to specific questions. For general concepts better use another resources

## Instructions
For today you will need to search information about 2 topics in javascript. One of them is familiar already. Try to learn the most you can about these topics as we will have a kahoot about it. The topics are Destructuring and Nesting.

### Destructuring
Destructuring normally is referenced for the destructuring assignment of variables. According to MDN: 

```
The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
```

It is pretty useful for taking specific elements from arrays or properties from objects. Here is a link with a video about it: [Video about destructuring assignment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIq3qLaHCIs&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified)


### Nesting
Nesting is called to have objects inside objects, arrays inside arrays or arrays and objects combined. The complex part is not much the creation of the variables with objects and arrays but accessing to the elements or properties we want. Here is an article that  explains more about nesting.

### Now is on you...
Now you have to search for the rest to complement these small pieces of info we gave you here. You also have the index.js file to look at some examples of both destructuring and nesting.
